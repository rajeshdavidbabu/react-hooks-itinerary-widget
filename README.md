## Description
The project is a simple react-hooks based widget for the daily itinerary, fetched from the server. Currently, it supports three card for ground, airport and flight travel. The data currently comes form a mock-server.

## Motivation
React is moving towards a class-less feature. So, its about time we got on that train as well. The hooks pattern might resemble a javascript-closure based encapsulation pattern. Though the state is no more associated with a component, one needs to be a bit more careful to stick out to the rules of the [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
